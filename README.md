# ENIGMA
A simple application that serves to illustrate how the Enigma works. This project was created for a school project. If you're interested in the history of the Enigma, you can find everything you need to know in this file. If you're not interested in its history but you still want to know how my Code works, you can read about it [here](#my-code).


## What's an Enigma?
The Enigma is a rotor encryption machine that was used by the German Wehrmacht during the Second World War to encrypt messages and military instructions. A simpler version of the Enigma was also used by services such as the police and the secret service at this time.      Despite the Enigma's comprehensive encryption system, the Allies managed to decipher the code at the end of the Second World War and decode most of the German radio messages.

## How do they work?
Unlike other methods of encryption used today, the Enigma is not necessarily a complex algorithm for encrypting data. On the contrary, the Enigma is basically 'just' a circuit between an input key and a light bulb, which displays the cipher after each keystroke. However, what made the Enigma so special and almost indecipherable at the time were three to four rollers located between the light bulbs and the input keys. Inside these were cables that led from one side of the cylinder to a specific socket on the other side. When a button on the Enigma is pressed, the current runs through a specific path through all three to four rollers, then through a so-called "reverse roller" back into the rollers. From there, it runs through the rollers again. From here, the current runs to the connected light bulb, which then indicates the letter to which the input was encrypted. As the code would have been easy to decipher in this way, the right-hand roller rotates clockwise by one position with each input. At a predetermined point, the right-hand roller rotates the middle roller once. The same applies to the next roller(s). This rotation of the individual rollers results in a completely new circuit after each input, which can lead, for example, to an "E" becoming an "A" and an "I" in the same sentence. This fact made it much more difficult for the Allies to decipher the Enigma code, making it almost impossible.  Despite this already extraordinarily strong encryption, the German military was not yet satisfied with the security of the Enigma. They therefore added another component to the circuit, which further increased the possibilities of encrypting a single word. A plug-in board was attached to the front part of the Enigma, usually with ten plugs attached. The plug-in board had 26 slots, one for each letter. By connecting all the cables, first 12 and later 16 letters could be "swapped". When one of the keys on the Enigma was pressed, the current did not run directly to the input roller, but first through the plug-in board. If the pressed letter is connected, the circuit continues from the connected letter to the entry roller. Once the current has run through all the rollers, it is passed through the plug-in board again, after which it flows to the corresponding light bulb. If a soldier received such a message back then, he had to do the following: First, he had to select the three specified rotors out of the five possible rotors and install them in the Enigma in the specified order.Then he had to turn the rotors to the setting specified for that day, after which he had to set the plug connections correctly.If he then re-entered the received message into the Enigma, he would again receive the desired plain text.The authorized sol-data received all this information from a so-called "key table", which was exchanged on a monthly basis.  All these factors led to an enormous number of possibilities for encrypting a single message.

## Who? When? Why?
Arthur Scherbius was the engineer who applied for a patent for the first model of such a cipher machine in 1918. He began selling it under the name "Gerät zur Übermittlung von geschäftlichen Mitteilungen und Telegrammen". Shortly afterwards, however, this machine disappeared from the market as the German military began to take an interest in his invention. When Scherbius died in 1929, the company "Heimsoeth & Rinke" began to develop the machine further. The encryption machine was mainly used in the German submarine fleet, as submarines could only be reached by telephone, which was considered very insecure. Thanks to the newly acquired method of encrypting instructions, the Germans were able to pass on instructions to the entire submarine fleet from land without any problems. As this gave the Germans an enormous advantage over their enemies, maintaining the secret of the Enigma was an extremely high priority. Thus, one of the most important instructions for admirals of the U-boat fleet was to throw all Enigma documents, including the Enigma, overboard in the event of a takeover of their own U-boat. For the same reason, for a short time there was an instruction under the code name "Rainbow". If a submarine or group of submarines of the German Wehrmacht were surrounded, they were instructed to sink their own submarine and destroy all details of the Enigma along with it. Despite clear instructions to destroy the Enigma before being taken over from the enemy, the British managed to force a submarine to surface in May 1941 and capture its Enigma. After securing the Enigma, it was taken to Bletchley Park, where the code was deciphered with the help of a Polish secret service agent and his three-man team. From the first of February 1942, however, a new Enigma was used by the military. Instead of the previously used Enigma M3, with three rotor rollers, the Enigma M4, with four rotor rollers, was now used. This upgrade meant that the Allies were no longer able to understand German messages. In October 1942, however, the British once again succeeded in capturing an Enigma. With the help of the Turing bomb, an invention by Alan Turing, the British were able to decipher the day keys required to decode the data encrypted by the Enigma. Another factor that made it easier for the British to crack the Enigma code was the strict regulations of the German military. Due to regulated beginnings of messages on topics such as the weather, the British were able to recognize connections and finally decipher the Enigma code. This immense advantage of the British military is said to have accelerated the end of the Second World War by several years.

## My Code
 
As already mentioned, the code in this repo is only intended to illustrate how the Enigma works. Because of this, the code is neither very clean nor very efficient.<br>
To simulate the rollers of the Enigma I decided to use 2 dimensional character arrays with 25 entries. Each roller, except for the reverse roller, has 2 “sides” which always contain a label and your connection to the other side of the roller. If you now enter a word using the terminal, each letter is sent through these arrays, resulting in a different letter. If the user has then added connectors, the conversion is repeated. After each letter, the “rollers” are rotated accordingly by setting the top index of the corresponding array to the last position. However, as the connections in the arrays always remain the same, encrypted messages can be decrypted again using the correct ring position. Just like the real Enigma, this code is not very complex but nevertheless effective in what it does.
